Cherry: Experimental configuration.
-----------------------------------------
@Cyrodwd/@BjankaDev - 2026

: What is Cherry?
Cherry is an experimental configuration language, inspired by traditional configuration files.

Its syntax is directly inspired by the traditional syntax of an assembler,
specifically the Intel style.

It is important to note that it has instructions (keywords), which may not be compatible.
Avoid including data with identifiers that conflict with the instructions.

: What is its purpose?
Cherry seeks to offer a more creative configuration format. Additionally, it saves
software configurations without falling into the complexity of TOML or JSON.

: What are its features?
Cherry has the simplest features possible for creating simple configurations.
Cherry offers <labels> to organise data.

:: Start of Q
------------------------

: What are labels?
Labels are equivalent to a namespace for data.
This exists so as not to confuse data, create unnecessarily complicated configurations
in terms of naming, etc.

Normally, everything under a <label> belongs to that label.

------------------------
:: End of Q

Additionally, it offers the ability to assign numerical values (integers and decimals), character strings
(strings), references/copies, lists, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

: What instructions are available in version 0.0.0 of Cherry?

Cherry, in its earliest version (v0.0.0), contains few instructions.
Below, they are shown with their name, translation, and description (purpose).

----------------------

# Instructions

## Assignment
<set> | SET | Assigns a new value (numeric, string, list, etc.)
<copy> | COPY | Copies the value of another piece of data to the destination
<gea> | GEnerate Attribute | Assigns an attribute to another piece of data (Version: v0.1.0)

Attributes will be taken into account in later versions.

# Label (syntax)
---------------------------
Must include an at sign at the beginning to specify that it is a label.

“@” < identifier > “:”
    ; Everything declared here is part of the label.

----------------------

# Syntax

<commentary> := “;” <character>*

<set> := < “set” >   ( <literal> | <list> ) “,” <identifier>
<ref> := < “ref” >   <identifier> “,” <identifier>
<gea> := < “gea” >    “[” (<identifier> “=” <literal>)+ “]” ',' <identifier>

<character> := A-Z, a-z
<identifier> := <character> | “_” ... <character>* | “_”* | <digit>*
<digit> := “0” | “1” | “2” | “3” | “4” | “5” | “6” | “7” | “8” | “9”
<list> := “{” <literal> [“,” <literal>+ ]? “}”
<literal> := < <number> | <string> >
<number> := [“-”]? <digit>+ [“.” <digit>+]?
<string> := “‘” <character-except-quote>+ '’'

Decimal values CANNOT start or end with a period (“.”).

Model (Error):
    .5
    1.
    .05

Scientific notation does not exist. <number> 'e' ['-']? <digit> cannot be used.
